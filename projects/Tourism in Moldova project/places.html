        <p>
            The Old Orhei museum complex is located in the Răut valley, a right tributary of the Dniester, on the territory of the Trebujeni 
            commune in the Orhei district of the Republic of Moldova.

            The Orheiul Vechi cultural-natural reserve, which has a special status 
            and is the most important cultural site in the Republic of Moldova, is also in the nomination process to be included in the 
            UNESCO World Heritage List. The complex includes several tens of hectares of the medieval city of Orhei 
            (XIII - XVI centuries), later named Orheiul Vechi (after the settlement was abandoned and a new town was founded elsewhere, with 
            the same name - today's Orheiul). The complex includes two large headlands (Peștere and Butuceni), which are joined by three 
            smaller adjacent headlands (Potarca, Selitra and Scoc), on whose territory are the ruins of fortifications, houses, baths, 
            places of worship (including monasteries caves) both from the Tatar-Mongol period (XIII - XIV centuries) and Moldavian (XV - XVI 
            centuries). 
            <br>
            The Old Orheiul Complex constitutes a system made up of cultural and natural elements: archaic natural landscape, 
            biodiversity, exceptional archaeological setting, historical-architectural variety, traditional rural habitat and ethnographic 
            originality.
